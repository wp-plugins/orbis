Orbis is a powerful, extendable plugin to boost up your business. Project Management, Customer Relation Management & More...

== Description ==

This plugin transforms your WordPress environment into a fully operating 
business tool. Orbis has some nice basic Project Management, Customer Relation 
Management & Intranet functionalities. Make Orbis even more powerfull with some 
cool additional plugins.

This plugin is built with idea to make business tools extendable. Every 
bussiness is different. We believe in the power of WordPress and although 
WordPress may not be your first idea to serve as a framework for such a tool, 
we feel it has shown many advantages, particularly with extendability and 
control. 

Orbis comes with a front-end theme with the very orginal name, Orbis. This 
theme is based on Bootstrap and gives you all the front-end functionality you
